            <p>This is my very first website... I have no Idea what to type here. I named it Clout because I had the idea of the brand being a cloud storage service like iCloud or Google drive. You really do not have to read this. Potato, Mango, Stranger Things, Final Space, I'm currently listening to Believer by Imagine Dragons. I'm literally just listing random stuff. You guys should cut soap for me o. I need money. Love youu. Byeee
